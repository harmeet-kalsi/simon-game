# simon-game
The object of the game is to repeat a series of random button clicks created by the game. After each round, the sequence becomes progressively longer and more complex which makes it harder to remember. Typically, youâ€™ll have four different buttons, each with a unique colour and sound which is activated when pressed.


In this project i decided to do a normal Simon game. It is a memory game where you have to follow the sequence and copy the sequence correctly to move on to the next level. The mode is pretty straight forward. When a coloured button flashes, you click on the button. When you get further on in the game you will have several colours to remember in order. The game gets harder the longer you play!
